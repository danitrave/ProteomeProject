This directory contains many different files that have been used for the development of a project for a course that I attended during my academic career which is called "Proteome, interactive and biological networks.
The final report of the project is the "Project_pibn.pdf" file. Therefore, one should read this document before looking at the scripts that has been developed.
These are compressed in a zipped folder called "Project_supmat.zip". Here we find:
- the script "parse_pdb.py" which is aimed to retrive information from files having the pdb format. The script contains different functions each able to accomplish a specific task. The role of each function is reported in set of commented lines before each function definition.
-the script "parse_dssp.py" which is aimed to retrive information from files having the dssp format. These files has been obtained using a proper dssp program running on a Linux system. The script contains different functions each able to accomplish a specific task. The role of each function is reported in set of commented lines before each function definition.
-the script "network.py" which is aimed to retrive information from the "Intact" file. The script contains different functions each able to accomplish a specific task which is related to the analysis of the biological networks which are reported in the intact file. The role of each function is reported in set of commented lines before each function definition.

All the PDB and DSSP files are contained in the folder called "PDB_DSSP_FILES"
The intact file is not provided because of its dimensions are too big.
The folder reports also a fast correlation analysis script done in R.
